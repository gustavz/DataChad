UPLOAD_HELP = """
You can upload a single or multiple files. With each upload, all files in the batch are embedded into a single vector store.\n
**Important**: If you upload new files after you already have uploaded files, a new vector store that includes all previously uploaded files is created.
This means for each combination of uploaded files, a new vector store is created.\n
To treat your new upload independently, you need to remove the previous uploads by clicking the `X`, right next to the uploaded file name.\n
**!!! All uploaded files are removed permanently from the app after the vector stores are created !!!**
